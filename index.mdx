Single page apps have a single point of failure.

Server side rendering your React application means not sending your user an empty `<div>` and a üôè

Server side rendering your React application
+ benefits your users in a tangible way
+ leverages your existing code

Likely, your `client.js`

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

---

and an `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>SSR</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <script src="./client.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
```

---

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import App from "./components/App";

export default function template(props) {
  const app = renderToString(<App {...props} />)
  return `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>SSR</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <div id="root">${app}</div>
          <script src="./client.js"></script>
      </body>
      </html>
  `;
}
```

---

```jsx
// server.js
import express from "express";
import template from "./template";

const app = express();

app.get("/*", (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
  res.end(template());
});

app.listen(3000);
```

What do I mean by server-side rendering?

How do I do that?

- React DOM comes with it
- a server of some kind


What concerns should I address?
- Routing
- Data-fetching
- dynamic imports
- Build process

Are there frameworks that handle this?

---

A picture of what this looks like

- One `<App />` on both server and client (`renderToString()` & `hydrate()`)
- Different lifecycles
- Build two different builds

---

## Frameworks

- Next.js
- Razzle + After.js
